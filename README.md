Friendica - your open and free social network
=============================================

Welcome to the free social web. Friendica is a platform for decentralised social communication linking to other independent social and corporate services.

Friendica connects you to a federated communications network of thousands of servers called the Fediverse. Through various protocols you can interact with anyone on [Friendica]( https://friendi.ca), [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/), [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org), [Misskey](https://join.misskey.page), [Peertube](https://joinpeertube.org/), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/), [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social) and many more. Receiving content from Tumblr, Wordpress and RSS is also possible. Friendica allows to import and mirror your content via add-ons such as ITTT and Buffer. You can customize and control how publicly or privately you want to share your content.

Being part of the Fediverse allows you to be free from data-harvesting corporations. Enjoy open social communication, independent of any specific provider.
